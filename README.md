2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign in with GitHub.
3. Click **“New Project” → Import Repository**.
4. Select your repo and hit **Deploy**.

Do you want me to also **add a `vercel.json` config file** (so it always uses `index.html` for root and keeps clean routes), or keep it minimal since it’s just static HTML?
